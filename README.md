## **BACKGROUND**

The online retailer under consideration in this article is a UK-based and registered non-store business with some 80 members of staff. The company was established in 1981 mainly selling unique all-occasion gifts. For years in the past, the merchant relied heavily on direct mailing catalogues, and orders were taken over phone calls. It was only in 2009, that the company launched its own web site and shifted completely to the Web. Since then, the company has maintained a steady and healthy number of customers from all parts of the United Kingdom and Europe and has accumulated a huge amount of data about many customers. The company also uses Amazon.co.uk to market and sell its products.
