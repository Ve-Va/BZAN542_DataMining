## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r AR with 3 clusters}

library(arulesViz)

    group_by(Invoice) %>%
    summarize(StockList=list(unique(StockCode)), DescList  = list(unique(Description)))

#summary(DESCrules2)

#Cluster 3
